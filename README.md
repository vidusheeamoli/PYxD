# PYxD

PYxD is a python script that downloads all comics on the xkcd archive. PYxD, like XKCD, is just a word with no phonetic pronunciation - a treasured and carefully-guarded point in the space of four-character strings. 

### Installing

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to run it

```
$ python xkcd.py
```

All the comics will be downloaded and saved in the output directory. Enjoy!
